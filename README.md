# White label exchange API documentation
The documentation for BTCTrader's white label exchange platform API.

These docs are for the APIs of BTCTurk and other BTCTrader partners.

## Usage
Append your exchange's URL to the beginning of the methods to use the API. For example, to get ticker info from BTCTurk, use [https://www.btcturk.com/api/ticker] (https://www.btcturk.com/api/ticker)

## Testing
You can use our testing platforms to test the APIs. The balances on the test sites are not real and do not represent any real value. The testing platforms work on Bitcoin TESTNET and you can deposit TESTNET coins to your account. The testing platforms are:

* [BTCTurk Test] (https://test.btcturk.com)

**Important** Our mobile applications will not work with the testing platforms. They can only be synced with our live platforms.

## Questions & Problems
Please use the [issues](https://github.com/BTCTrader/broker-api-docs/issues) on this github project to ask questions and report bugs.

## API Authentication

All API calls related to a user account require authentication.

You need to provide 3 parameters to authenticate a request:

* "X-PCK": API key
* "X-Stamp": Nonce
* "X-Signature": Signature

#### API key

You can create the API key from the Account > API Access page in your exchange account.

#### Nonce

Nonce is a regular integer number. It must be increasing with every request you make.

A common practice is to use unix timestamp for that parameter.

#### Signature

Signature is a HMAC-SHA256 encoded message. The HMAC-SHA256 code must be generated using a private key that contains a timestamp and your API key

Example (C#):
```c#
string message = yourAPIKey + nonce;
using (HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(Convert.FromBase64String(yourPrivateKey)))
{
   byte[] signatureBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message));
   string X-Signature = Convert.ToBase64String(signatureBytes);
}
```
After creating the parameters, you have to send them in the HTML Header of your request with their name

Example (C#):
```c#
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-PCK", yourAPIKey);
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-Stamp", nonce.ToString());
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("X-Signature", signature);
```

Warning: Your IP address can be blocked if you make too many unauthorized requests. Make sure you implement the authentication method properly.
